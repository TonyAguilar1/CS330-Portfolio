**How do I approach designing software?**
I usually start with a visual idea or concept, in this case, I knew I wanted to model a video game controller using low-polygon 3D shapes. From there, I break down the design into smaller parts: what shapes make up the object, what the scene needs (like a floor or background), and how users will interact with it. I think about what I want the program to look like and feel like, and then design the components to support that.

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
This project definitely sharpened my ability to break complex objects down into basic geometric components like spheres, boxes, and cylinders. I also learned how to work within limitations (like polygon count and object limits), and how to design around those with creative solutions. Visually, it also helped me think more critically about lighting, texture mapping, and composition.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**
I started with a rough mental sketch of the object (the controller) and figured out how to recreate it with primitives. Then I iteratively tested the look and adjusted as I went , moving boxes around, resizing shapes, and later adding textures. I followed a "build ,test , tweak" process over and over until it felt right.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
The "build small and iterate" approach will definitely help in future software projects, especially when working with visual or interactive elements. It’s easy to get stuck planning forever, but getting a rough version running helps you see what works and what doesn’t much faster.

**How do I approach developing programs?**
I usually start from examples or templates and then start modifying based on what I need. For this project, I relied a lot on trial and error and debugging. I break development into phases , load textures, set up lighting, render objects, then test interactions.

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
One big one was texture management , I implemented a texture loading system that tied specific textures to objects. I also learned to use shaders more effectively for lighting and material control. Toward the end, I added conditions for things like object disappearance and dynamic material swapping (like damage textures).

**How did iteration factor into your development?**
It was constant. I'd load a shape, see that it looked off or was placed wrong, and tweak it. Then I’d change lighting, run it again, and so on. Iteration helped me catch rendering bugs, lighting issues, and make the scene look more polished.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?**
Early on, I was just trying to get things on screen. Later, I focused on optimizing and making the code cleaner and more modular. I added conditionals, functions for loading textures, and kept refining the structure. I learned to not just "make it work," but make it work in a way that’s easy to manage and improve.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
Computer science opens the door to building interactive things from scratch, whether it’s games, tools, simulations, or artistic visualizations. Knowing how to code gives me the power to bring my ideas to life and solve real-world problems creatively.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
They’ve helped me see the math and code behind visual systems , like how transformations, lighting, and projections work. That’ll help me in any future work involving simulations, modeling, or even UI/UX design because I now understand how visual logic connects to data and behavior.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
Professionally, knowing how to work with graphics and rendering engines could help in fields like game development, AR/VR, or even architectural visualization. It’s also taught me how to debug complex visual systems and how to think in both visual and logical terms, which is a huge asset in any software-related field.
